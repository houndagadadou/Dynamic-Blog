          <h5 class="card-title">Things Life Is too Short to Worry About</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Disclaimer: If you can relate to any of these signs, please do not take this feedback as an attack on your character.  This article was meant to be a self-improvement guide for those of you who have been feeling a little stuck.<br>

            Do you consider yourself a constant worrier?<br> 
            
            Worrying is a feeling that no one is exempt from. It can be felt when you face any sort of uncertainty. But constantly worrying about trivial things is best avoided if you want to live life to the fullest.<br>
            
            Here are 10 things life is too short to worry about.<br>
            <h5>The Past</h5>
            
            Do you often go back to that one time that makes you cringe in embarrassment?<br>
            
            The past is a distant memory. We have no control over what we’ve done when we were younger, and your younger self did not have the wisdom that you possess now. You have the agency to think about what you like. But replaying bad thoughts in your head takes time away from you to be happy at the present. And, according to Melbourne psychotherapist Tim Hill, there is little pleasure or insight to be gained from rumination, and it’s more associated with anxiety and depression. Practicing mindfulness and positive self-talk can be a good first step in bringing yourself to the present more.<br>
            <h5>The Future</h5>
            
            Do you worry about the worst-case scenario? Are you paranoid all the time, prohibiting you from taking action?<br>
            
            Uncertainty can be a scary thing to ponder, and the uncertainty of the future even more. But by constantly worrying about the future, we interfere with our ability to function in the present moment. It can even make it harder for people with panic disorder or agoraphobia to recover faster, according to clinical professional counselor Sheryl Ankrom. Analyzing risks, identifying worrying thoughts, and learning relaxation techniques can help mitigate this form of worry.<br>
            <h5>Haters</h5>
            
            Are you worried about people who openly hate you? Does it get on your nerve?<br>
            
            No matter what you do, whether it’s good or bad, there will always be someone who gives you the side-eye. It’s something that we have no control over. But let’s face it, many celebrities and people can take millions of people denouncing their accomplishments, and yet they still continue making money doing what they do. Whether people scrutinize you or not, the truth is they have zero business making an impact between you and your goals. Don’t stress out over them.<br>
           <h5>Aging</h5> 
            
            Are you worried about growing old?<br>
            
            Life is a marathon, not a race. Understandably, we can feel stress, anxiety, fear, worry, and doubt the more decades we have under our belt. But instead of worrying about the process, try to fix your mind at the present moment. You can’t speed up or slow down the time of the day, so be at peace with it, and make decisions that you can look back on that will make your future self glad you did.<br>
            <h5>People’s Opinions</h5>
            
            Do you worry about people judging you? Are you afraid of posting on social media for fear of people thinking bad about you?<br>
            
            You may consciously or unconsciously seek approval from the people you surround yourself with. Whether it’s parents, friends, classmates, or even people you don’t see often, you may give people command over your life by how they think we should act. Usually, the way to usurp these feelings is by realizing that it’s you, and only you, that is in charge of your life. You make your own decisions — not your parents, not your teachers. You.<br>
            <h5>What People Are Doing</h5>
            
            Do you fear that your friends made a secret group chat solely to make fun of you? <br>
            
            If you’re constantly worrying about what other people do, you’ll paralyze yourself and not live the life you want. No one can dictate the life that you want for yourself; your dreams, goals, and ambitions are valid no matter how simple or how big they may be. If you worry about other people’s actions, you will end up falling behind them and going down the wrong path. Forge your own path regardless of people’s actions, and be the inspiration that you constantly crave for.<br>
            <h5>Your Image</h5>
            
            Do you fear rumors conspiring against you?<br>
            
            Many people, especially younger ones, tend to be conscious about how they appear and come across as to their peers. It’s an intrinsic feeling to feel like you’re part of the tribe, after all. But in doing so, you’re damaging your true self by hiding who you really are. By putting on a mask, you’re pushing down the very insecurities that are a part of you. Instead, recognize and accept that flawed part of yourself and show it off to the world. Life is too short to worry about impressing the wrong people.<br>
            <h5>Money</h5>
            
            Do you fear waking up every day, dragging yourself to the same routine job for a paycheck?<br>
            
            Earning money is a constant struggle. We need to uphold our physiological and safety needs, after all. But the constant pursuit for more material wealth is a worry that is better off leaving behind. A study by Ayalla Ruvio et al. shows that materialistic beliefs can cause stressful feelings, even when they aren’t directly related to material things. So instead of worrying about money, reorient yourself and strive to achieve a more fulfilling life, unique to you.<br>
            <h5>What’s Outside Your Control</h5>
            
            Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.<br>
            
            Some people who resist that notion believe that they’re preventing bad situations from happening by gaining more control. But in truth all they’re really doing is keeping themselves occupied and draining time and energy by excessively micromanaging and worrying about things beyond your control. If you worry about this, steps you can follow are determining what you can control, creating a plan to manage your stress, and developing healthy affirmations. <br>
            <h5>Making Mistakes</h5>
            
            Are you always trying to reach a higher standard?<br>
            
            No matter how much we try to reach it, living a perfect life is one of the mind’s illusions. We try to protect ourselves from the vulnerability that comes with making mistakes, but there are still chances for things to go wrong no matter what. Once you experience a grave mistake, realize that the decision your past self made is the best they could come up with at that time. Then move on.<br>
            Closing Thoughts
            
            Did you notice any of the above examples happen in your daily life?<br>
            
            We hope that you’ve learned from things to stop worrying about.</p>
